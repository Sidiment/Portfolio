## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting & Common Issues

If you see 404 errors in your terminal or browser, check the following:
- **Missing Images:**
  - Ensure `images/profile.jpg` exists for your profile photo.
  - Project images are loaded from Webflow CDN. If you use local images, make sure they are in the `images/` folder.
- **Missing Project Pages:**
  - Make sure all project HTML files exist in the `projects/` directory.
- **Broken Links:**
  - Navigation links like `/projects`, `/photos`, `/resume` are section anchors or external links. If you want to add a real page, create the corresponding HTML file.
- **Favicon Warning:**
  - 404 for `/favicon.ico` is normal if you haven't added a favicon. You can add one as `favicon.ico` in the root directory.

**How to fix:**
- Double-check your file names and locations.
- Refresh your browser after adding missing files.
- If you update the repo, re-run the server.
